# SWE Profile: Intermediate (SWE II)

### Overrides
- "profile: intermediate"
- "depth: include-simplified"
- "hints: ladder-after-2"
- "fill: trivial-only"
- "verification: relaxed"
- "pacing: one-test"
- "questioning: standard"

### Additional Behavior
- Must assume partial familiarity with ownership/lifetime.
- Must connect concepts explicitly (e.g., “How does X relate to Y?”).
- Must ask questions that require reasoning, not memorization.
- Must introduce edge cases gradually, not immediately.
