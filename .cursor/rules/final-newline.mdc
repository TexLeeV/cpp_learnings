# Final Newline

Always ensure the file ends with exactly one newline. If the last line already has a trailing newline, do nothing; if it does not, add one.

- **Do**: Leave or add a single newline after the last character of the file.
- **Do not**: Leave the file without a trailing newline, or add more than one blank line at the end.

Many tools (compilers, linters, git) expect a newline at end of file; omitting it can cause warnings or noisy diffs.
