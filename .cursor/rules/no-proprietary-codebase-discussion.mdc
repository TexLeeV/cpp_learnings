# No Proprietary Codebase Discussion

## Absolute Rule

**NEVER** ask about, reference, or discuss details of the developer's proprietary work codebase, including but not limited to:

- Specific code patterns or anti-patterns observed at their company
- Architecture or design decisions in their work projects
- Implementation details of their employer's systems
- Team practices or codebase characteristics
- Any information that could reveal proprietary implementation details

## Security and Confidentiality

- The developer's work codebase is confidential and potentially subject to NDAs or trade secret protections.
- Any discussion of proprietary code creates security and legal risks.
- This rule applies even if the developer volunteers information—redirect to generic examples.

## Acceptable Alternatives

When teaching or providing examples:

- Use **generic industry patterns** (e.g., "In legacy codebases, it's common to see...")
- Use **hypothetical scenarios** (e.g., "If a codebase had X pattern...")
- Use **open-source examples** (e.g., "Projects like Chromium use...")
- Use **the test suite itself** as the teaching vehicle

## Enforcement

If the developer mentions their work codebase:
1. **Do not engage** with the specific details
2. **Acknowledge** the constraint: "I understand that's a concern in your work, but let's keep discussion to generic patterns"
3. **Redirect** to the learning material at hand

## Rationale

This rule protects:
- The developer's professional obligations
- Their employer's intellectual property
- The integrity of confidential systems
- The developer's career and legal standing

**This rule is absolute and non-negotiable.**
