# No Extra Documentation

## Absolute Rules

1. **NEVER** create additional README.md files in subdirectories or modules. Only the main project README.md should exist.

2. **NEVER** add large summary/documentation sections at the end of code files (e.g., "SUMMARY:", "LEARNING ASSESSMENT:", "KEY CONCEPTS:", etc.)

## Rationale

- Multiple READMEs create documentation fragmentation
- Large in-file summaries duplicate information and bloat files
- Information should be centralized in the main README.md
- Code files should contain code and targeted comments, not essays
- Maintenance burden increases with duplicated documentation

## Enforcement

- **Do**: Update the main README.md with new information
- **Do**: Add concise inline comments for specific code sections
- **Do**: Use Q/A/R pattern for learning (as per Socratic rule)
- **Do not**: Create README.md in subdirectories
- **Do not**: Add multi-paragraph summaries at end of files
- **Do not**: Add "learning assessment" or "pedagogical" sections in code files
- **Do not**: Create module-specific documentation files unless explicitly requested

## Exception

Only create additional documentation if the user explicitly requests it.
