## Motivation

Why is this feature valuable? What gap does it fill in the learning path?

## Proposed Exercises

If applicable, describe the types of exercises or patterns you envision:

1. **Exercise Type**: [e.g., fill-in, broken/fixed, compile-fail]
2. **Focus Area**: [e.g., lifetime management, thread safety, performance]
3. **Q/A/R Questions**: Example questions that would help learners understand the concept

## Sample Code/Patterns (Optional)
